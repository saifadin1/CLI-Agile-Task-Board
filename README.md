🧩 CLI Agile Task Board
📌 Project Overview

CLI Agile Task Board is a command-line Agile project management system built using C++ and SQLite.
The project simulates the core functionalities of tools like Jira and HacknPlan, allowing users to manage tasks, workflows, and Agile boards through a terminal interface.

This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering academic project to apply Agile concepts, UML design, and software architecture principles.

🚀 Features

Create and manage Agile tasks

Update task status (To Do, In Progress, Done)

Store and retrieve data using SQLite

Command Line Interface (CLI) interaction

Agile task board simulation

Modular and scalable architecture

🛠️ Technologies Used
💻 Programming Language

C++

🗄️ Database

SQLite3

🧰 Tools

Jira (used for Agile planning and task tracking during development)

Git & GitHub

UML Modeling Tools using Draw.io

📊 UML Diagrams

The system was designed using Software Engineering UML models:

Use Case Diagram

Class Diagram

Sequence Diagram

These diagrams helped in defining system behavior, architecture, and interactions before implementation.
